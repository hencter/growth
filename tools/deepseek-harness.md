  DeepSeek Harness (DSH) is the agent runtime the Nova vault runs on: AGENTS.md mounts as workspace instructions with zero config, the tool stack is the native set below, and capability extension happens through the Cordis composition and dynamic plugins — not through files inside the vault.

# DeepSeek Harness

DeepSeek Harness (DSH) is the agent runtime the Nova vault runs on (since 2026-08). The vault itself stays runtime-agnostic — the harness-specific layer is one tool-boundary table and a portability map in `AGENTS.md` §9.

## Runtime Model

- **Composition**: DSH is composed from [[agent-extensibility|Cordis plugins]]. A **host composition** holds shared registries (persistence, sandbox/approval stack, model route, subagent registry); an **agent preset** contributes one session's tools, persona, and prompt sections via `cordis.yml`.
- **Two planes**: Host runs in the Node.js process (files, networking, commands, model tools); Client runs in the browser page (UI slots, themes). Client→Host calls cross via package-private JSON methods.
- **Workspace instructions**: `AGENTS.md` in the working directory is mounted as per-session instructions — no config file needed (contrast: opencode requires `opencode.json` → `instructions`).
- **Skill catalog**: skills are registered in the composition; the `skill` tool loads those. The vault's own skills live in `.agents/skills/` (Agent Skills Standard path) — auto-scanned into the catalog per project root, so `skill` loads them by name.

## Native Tool Stack

| Class | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| Files | `read` (line-numbered, image support), `write`, `edit` (string replace), `glob`, `grep` |
| Shell | `pwsh` (PowerShell; sandboxed — read-only runs ConstrainedLanguage) |
| Research | `web_search` |
| Delegation | `subagent`, `subagent_fork` (background by default), `workflow` (scripted fan-out), `ralph` (fresh-agent loops), `list_agents` / `send_message` / `interrupt_agent` (durable subagent lifecycle) |
| Goals | `create_goal` / `get_goal` / `update_goal` — long-running objectives across continuation rounds; goals arm/disarm and carry a revision number |
| Jobs | background jobs with `job_list` / `job_output` / `job_kill` |
| Bridge | `weixin_bot` — WeChat bridge: status / login (QR) / logout / send / interject / sendFile |
| Cordis Inspect | `cordis_inspect_list` / `cordis_inspect_query` / `cordis_inspect_self` — read-only capability discovery (services, events, slots, builtins, own plugins) before defining packages |
| UI | `ask_user_question`, `todo_write` |

## Safety Model

- **File sandbox**: read-only / workspace-write / danger-full-access modes. A denial is policy, not a bug — do not work around it or retry it another way.
- **Approval prompts**: gate dynamic-plugin runs and sandbox escalation; when disabled, denials are final.
- **Dynamic plugins**: temporary Cordis plugins defined and run inside the process (`cordis_define` / `cordis_run`); versions are immutable Packages under a `pluginId` with run / update / rollback / stop / undefine lifecycle. Definitions do not survive a process restart. The `cordis_inspect_*` tools are read-only discovery — they confirm APIs before code is written and never replace business Services.

## Contrast with OpenCode

| Aspect | DeepSeek Harness | OpenCode |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Config | Cordis composition (`cordis.yml`) | `opencode.json` |
| Instructions | workspace `AGENTS.md` auto-mount | `instructions` paths |
| Skills | composition-registered catalog | directory scanning (`skills.paths`) |
| Extensions | dynamic Cordis plugins (Host/Client) | JS plugins |
| Subagents | prompt-based `subagent` tools | typed agents in `.opencode/agents/` |
| Shell | `pwsh` (PowerShell) | `Bash` |

## Vault Impact

- `AGENTS.md` §9 names the DSH native tool stack; the vault keeps no runtime-specific config files.
- OpenCode-era artifacts (`opencode.json`, `.opencode/`) were removed in 2026-08 when the vault went DSH-only.
- `_agents/*.md` hold portable subagent prompts; under DSH pass their content as the `subagent` tool prompt.
- Harness composition files live outside the vault (`~/.dsh`); vault operations never edit them.
