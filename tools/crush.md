# Crush

**Crush** is the terminal AI coding agent by [Charm](https://charm.sh) (charmbracelet) — the official successor of OpenCode. When the original `opencode-ai/opencode` repository was archived (2025-09-18), the community fork `anomalyco/opencode` continued under the OpenCode name while the original authors relaunched their line as Crush, emerging "from the OpenCode controversy with a polished terminal relaunch" (launched 2025-07). The two lines share the same client-server ancestry but diverge in stack, configuration, and ecosystem.

## Positioning

- **"BYOK generation"**: model-agnostic, bring-your-own-key — positioned as an open-source alternative to [[claude-code|Claude Code]] rather than a provider-bound agent.
- **Charm-polished TUI**: first-class terminal UX from the Bubble Tea ecosystem (same lineage as Glow/Gum); a deliberate differentiator against utilitarian agent UIs.
- **Adoption signals**: third-party harnesses add Crush as a client (e.g. harness-cli multi-client expansion), and its built-in `crush-config` skill is indexed on skills registries (SkillsMP). Size/version as recorded in [[opencode|OpenCode]] §15 (v0.84.1, 26.5k stars).

## Stack & Architecture

- **Go + Bubble Tea** TUI, from the Charm ecosystem.
- Inherits OpenCode's decoupled client-server core loop — full architecture analysis in [[opencode-architecture|OpenCode Architecture]]; a detailed successor comparison table lives in [[opencode|OpenCode]] §15.

## Configuration

- **`crush.json`** — expanded schema replacing `opencode.json`; the 8-level merge precedence model is preserved ([[opencode|OpenCode]] §15.4).
- Config home: `~/.config/crush/`.
- **Global context**: `~/.config/crush/CRUSH.md` + `~/.config/AGENTS.md` — the shared `AGENTS.md` convention this vault itself runs on.
- Declarative OS integration exists (e.g. Nix Home Manager `programs.crush` options).

## Skills & Extensibility

- **Multi-runtime skill paths**: `.agents/skills/`, `.crush/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/` — Crush reads skill directories written for other agents, a concrete implementation of the cross-tool portability described in [[agent-skills-standard|Agent Skills Standard]].
- Built-in `crush-config` skill documents providers, LSP servers, and settings.

## Crush vs OpenCode vs Claude Code

| Aspect | Crush | OpenCode (anomalyco) | Claude Code |
|--------|-------|----------------------|-------------|
| Origin | Original authors (Charm), relaunch of archived opencode-ai line | Community fork continuing the OpenCode name | Anthropic |
| Stack | Go + Bubble Tea TUI | Original TS stack | Closed-source, Anthropic-first |
| Config | `crush.json` (expanded) | `opencode.json` | `CLAUDE.md` + settings |
| Skills | Multi-runtime paths (`.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`) | `.opencode/skills/` | `.claude/skills/` |

## Vault Relevance

- This vault's skills are Agent-Skills-Standard files; `.agents/skills/auto-commit/SKILL.md` names Crush as a compatible runtime — Crush's multi-runtime skill paths are the working evidence behind that compatibility claim.
- OpenCode remains a reference architecture here ([[opencode-architecture]]); Crush is its canonical "where the original line went" successor, tracked alongside the fork.
