# Concept Note Template

Copy this template when creating a new concept note. Replace all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values.

## Frontmatter Template

```yaml

tags:
  - {{tag1}}
  - {{tag2}}
  - {{tag3}}
timestamp: {{YYYY-MM-DD}}T00:00:00Z
id: "{{YYYYMMDDThhmmss}}"
status: {{seedling | budding | evergreen}}
difficulty: {{beginner | intermediate | advanced}}
domain: {{knowledge-domain}}
prerequisites:
  - /path/to/prerequisite-note.md
related:
  - "[[Related Note A]]"
  - "[[Related Note B]]"
sources:
  - title: "{{Source Title}}"
    url: "{{https://...}}"
confidence: {{0.0-1.0}}

## Section Structure

### Required Sections

#### 1. Title (H1)
```markdown
# {{Display Title}}
```
The H1 should match the `title` in frontmatter. Use title case.

#### 2. Overview (optional H2)
```markdown
## Overview

{{2-4 sentences establishing what this concept is, why it matters, and what the reader will understand after reading.}}
```

#### 3. Core Content (H2 sections)
Organize the body into logical H2 sections. The number and names depend on the concept, but common patterns include:

```markdown
## {{Key Idea 1}}

{{Explanation, examples, diagrams.}}

## {{Key Idea 2}}

{{Explanation, examples, diagrams.}}

## {{Comparison / Tradeoffs}}

{{When applicable, compare alternatives or tradeoffs.}}

## {{Related Concepts}}

{{Brief pointers to connected ideas, with wiki links.}}
```

#### 4. See Also (H2, optional)
```markdown
## See Also

- [[Related Note A]] — {{Why it's related}}
- [[Related Note B]] — {{Why it's related}}
```

#### 5. Citations (H2, if external sources used)
```markdown
## Citations

1. [{{Source Name}}]({{URL}})
2. [{{Source Name}}]({{URL}})
```

## Status Lifecycle Guide

Choose the correct `status` for the note's current state:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> seedling: Just an idea or stub
    seedling --> budding: Actively developing
    seedling --> deleted: Abandoned before content
    budding --> evergreen: Complete and stable
    evergreen --> superseded: Better note replaces it
    evergreen --> archived: No longer relevant
    superseded --> archived: Historical reference only
```

- **seedling**: Use when creating a stub for an identified gap. Content is sparse.
- **budding**: Use while actively writing the note. Content is growing.
- **evergreen**: Use when the note is complete, reviewed, and stable.
- **superseded**: Use when a newer/better note covers the same concept. Link to the replacement.
- **archived**: Use for historical reference. Remove from active `index.md` entries.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy** this template to the target path (e.g., `/concepts/new-concept.md`)
2. **Replace** all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values with real content
3. **Set status** to `seedling` initially, promote as content matures
4. **Generate id**: Use current timestamp in `YYYYMMDDThhmmss` format
5. **Add links**: Minimum 1-3 links in `related` and/or `prerequisites`
6. **Update indexes**: Add the new note to the appropriate `index.md`
7. **Cross-link**: Add this note to the `related` field of linked notes
8. **Log**: Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Created: {{title}}`
