Use when linting link health, checking the knowledge graph, or when the human reads this vault in Obsidian. Falls back to harness-native tools when the CLI is unavailable.

# Obsidian CLI — Vault Query Skill

This vault is read by humans in **Obsidian**. Obsidian ships an official CLI (`obsidian`) that exposes the app's own graph cache — link resolution, backlinks, orphans, tags, properties — which is ground truth for what the human actually sees. Prefer it over re-deriving the graph with `grep` when available.

> **Runtime note (DeepSeek Harness)**: this vault skill lives in `.agents/skills/` and is auto-registered in the DSH skill catalog — load it via the `skill` tool when the workflow applies (AGENTS.md §8); run CLI commands via `pwsh`.

## Availability Check (Lazy)

Only check when about to use it:

```bash
obsidian version
```

- **Success** → CLI available, use the mappings below.
- **Failure** (not installed, or Obsidian app not running) → fall back to harness-native tools (`grep`/`glob`/`read`) silently. Never block vault operations on CLI absence.
- Windows note: the binary is `Obsidian.com` (console wrapper), exposed as `obsidian` on PATH by the installer.

## Lint Mappings (AGENTS.md §2.3)

| Lint check | Obsidian CLI | Native fallback |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Orphan notes (zero inbound links) | `obsidian orphans` | Grep for `[[name]]` across vault |
| Dead-end notes (zero outbound links) | `obsidian deadends` | Read each note, check for links |
| Broken/unresolved links | `obsidian unresolved verbose` | Grep all `[[...]]`, Glob targets |
| Backlinks for a note | `obsidian backlinks file=<name>` | Grep `[[<name>]]` |
| Outgoing links of a note | `obsidian links file=<name>` | Read the note |
| Tag inventory | `obsidian tags counts` | Grep frontmatter `tags:` |
| Property/frontmatter audit | `obsidian properties counts` | Grep frontmatter keys |
| Full-text search | `obsidian search query=<text>` | harness `grep` |

Add `total` to most commands for a count only; `format=json` where supported for parsing.

## Write Operations

**Content edits still go through the harness `write`/`edit` tools** — they are permission-audited. Use the CLI only for Obsidian-native behaviors that file writes cannot replicate:

- `obsidian daily:append content=<text>` — append to the user's daily note
- `obsidian open file=<name>` — open a note in the user's Obsidian (when the user asks "show me")
- `obsidian template:insert name=<tpl>` — insert an Obsidian template into the active file

## Hard Rules

1. **Never** run `plugin:install`, `plugin:uninstall`, `theme:set`, `plugins:restrict`, `restart`, or `delete ... permanent` without an explicit user request.
2. **Never** use `eval` or `dev:*` commands — they bypass the permission model entirely.
3. `file=<name>` resolves like a wikilink (fuzzy); `path=<folder/note.md>` is exact. Prefer `path=` in automated operations to avoid ambiguity.
4. Multi-vault systems: pass `vault=<name>` only if `obsidian vault` shows the wrong active vault.
