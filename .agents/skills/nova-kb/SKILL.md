# Nova KB — Knowledge Base Maintenance Skill

> **Agent Skills Standard**: This skill conforms to the [[agent-skills-standard|Agent Skills Standard]] (agentskills.io). Compatible with any Agent Skills-compliant runtime including Crush, Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.
>
> **Runtime note (DeepSeek Harness)**: this vault skill lives in `.agents/skills/` and is auto-registered in the DSH skill catalog — load it via the `skill` tool when the workflow applies (AGENTS.md §8).

You are maintaining the **Nova Knowledge Vault** (the directory containing `AGENTS.md`). This skill enables you to perform vault maintenance operations efficiently and correctly.

## Core Workflows

### Ingest — New Knowledge Acquisition

When you receive new source material (research, articles, conversation insights, code):

1. **Read the source** thoroughly — understand its key concepts
2. **Identify what's new** — what concepts, patterns, or insights does this add?
3. **Extract atomic concepts** — each distinct idea gets its own note
4. **Determine the right directory**:
   - Core concepts → `/concepts/`
   - Tool-specific → `/tools/`
   - Architectural patterns → `/patterns/`
5. **Create/update notes** with complete frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   type: Concept|Tool|Pattern
   title: "Clear Title"
   description: One-line summary
   tags:
     - relevant
     - tags
   id: "YYYYMMDDThhmmss"
   status: seedling|budding|evergreen|superseded|archived
   difficulty: beginner|intermediate|advanced
   domain: knowledge-domain
   prerequisites:
     - "[[note-slug]]"
   related:
     - "[[Related Note]]"
   sources:
     - title: "Source"
       url: "https://..."
   confidence: 0.85
   summary: >-
     One-sentence executive summary.
   ---
   ```
6. **Cross-link** — ensure ≥1 existing note links the new note (inbound edge); update `related` fields on existing notes that should reference the new note
7. **Update hubs** — add entry to the relevant cluster hub (`concepts.md`/`tools.md`/`patterns.md`, all `type: Index`)
8. **Log it** — append to `/log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | <Brief description>`

### Query-File — Filing Good Answers

When you answer a question and the answer has lasting value:

1. Write a new concept note in `/concepts/` capturing the synthesized answer
2. Add complete frontmatter with `type: Concept`
3. Link to all source notes referenced in the answer
4. Add to `concepts.md`
5. Log: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] query-filed | <Topic>`

### Lint — Health Check

Run lint at session end (shutdown sequence) and on `/lint`:

1. **Contradiction scan**: Search the vault for conflicting claims. Two notes claiming opposite things about the same concept.
2. **Orphan detection**: Find notes with zero inbound wiki links (not listed in any hub file (`type: Index`), not referenced in any note's `related` or body).
3. **Missing cross-link scan**: Notes sharing tags/domain within a community (directory) that are not cross-linked.
4. **Broken links**: Wiki links `[[Target]]` pointing to non-existent notes.
5. **Staleness check**: Notes with `status: superseded` that still appear in index files, or current notes referencing outdated/superseded concepts.
6. **Promotion audit (grep, mechanical)**: grep `log.md` for `fix` entries missing `→ [[artifact]]`/`→ §N` and not marked `lesson: trivial` — unresolved debts.
7. **Version sync**: `index.md` statistics block must reflect `AGENTS.md` footer version.
8. **Report findings** in `/log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] lint | <Summary>`

**Auto-fix rules**:
- Fix broken links by finding the correct target or removing the link
- Add missing cross-references where semantically appropriate
- Mark superseded notes with `status: superseded` and update frontmatter
- Route unpromoted traces by severity (§2.5): trivial → mark `lesson: trivial`; critical/normal → promote
- NEVER delete notes — only change status

### Promotion — Trace → Standard

When you complete a fix, mistake, or discover a recurring problem (AGENTS.md §2.5):

1. **Severity gate**: critical (data loss/contradiction/security/recurrence) → must promote; normal (reusable lesson) → promote; trivial (typo/one-off) → record only
2. **Record the trace**: every `fix` log entry must end with `→ [[artifact]]`, `→ §N`, or `| lesson: trivial`
3. **Root-cause**: why did this error happen?
4. **Promote**: recurring operational error → AGENTS.md rule (within line budget); conceptual → concept note; tool/pattern → tools/ or patterns/
5. **Register**: record the promotion in `_meta/promotions.md` (ledger)
6. **Wire the edges**: update `related` fields, hubs, and the ledger

### Cross-Reference — Strengthening the Graph

Regularly review the knowledge graph for connection opportunities:

1. For each note in `/concepts/`, check if its `related` field covers all semantically connected notes
2. For new notes, ensure at least 2-3 incoming links exist (add to `related` fields of existing notes)
3. Update `prerequisites` chains — check that dependency order makes educational sense
4. Check tag consistency — same concepts should share domain/type tags

## Directory Quick Reference

| Directory | For |
|-----------|-----|
| `/concepts/` | Atomic concept notes (abstract ideas) |
| `/tools/` | Tool-specific deep dives |
| `/patterns/` | Design patterns and architectures |
| `/_identity/` | Nova's self-conception and capabilities |
| `/_meta/` | Vault-about-the-vault (architecture, conventions, promotions ledger) |
| `/templates/` | Note templates |
| `/index.md` | Top-level catalog |
| `/concepts.md` + `/tools.md` + `/patterns.md` + `/_meta.md` + `/_identity.md` + `/conference.md` | Cluster hubs (`type: Index`) |
| `/log.md` | Chronological memory (trace layer) |
| `/AGENTS.md` | Schema layer (rules) |

## Log Format

Always use this format for log entries:
```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] operation | Description
- Bullet points with specific actions
- Files created/modified
- Key decisions
```

Operations: `init`, `ingest`, `query-filed`, `lint`, `fix`, `session`, `cross-reference`, `refactor`

**Fix entries** must end with `→ [[artifact]]`, `→ §N`, or `| lesson: trivial` (§2.5 hard format).
