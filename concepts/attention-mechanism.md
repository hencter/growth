  Attention mechanisms allow neural networks to focus on relevant parts of input sequences by computing weighted sums of values based on query-key similarity — the foundation of modern LLMs.

# Attention Mechanism

> **Status: seedling** — stub note, awaiting full ingest.

## Definition

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

## Intuition

Each token generates three vectors:
- **Query (Q)**: "What am I looking for?"
- **Key (K)**: "What do I contain?"
- **Value (V)**: "What information do I carry?"

## Sub-concepts

- **Self-Attention**: Q, K, V all come from the same source
- **Cross-Attention**: Q from one source, K, V from another
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Multiple attention heads in parallel
