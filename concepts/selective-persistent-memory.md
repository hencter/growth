# Selective Persistent Memory

## Overview

Agentic LLM systems face a fundamental context problem: each session starts from zero, requiring the agent to relearn task specifications, data schemas, tool configurations, and output constraints every time. The naive solution — persisting entire conversation histories — is **counterproductive**: irrelevant context from past sessions degrades generation quality, achieving only 71% task completion versus 79% with no memory at all.

Selective persistent memory solves this by retaining only **four reusable context categories** while aggressively discarding session-specific reasoning traces. The result is **96% task completion** — a 17% improvement over no-memory baselines and a 25% improvement over full-history persistence.

## The Counterintuitive Finding

Full-history persistence is not just unhelpful — it is **actively harmful**. The paper demonstrates across 3 enterprise scenarios and 4 public datasets:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Task Completion Rate"
        direction TB
        NM[No Memory<br/>79%] --> |baseline| AXIS
        FH[Full History<br/>71%] --> |worse!| AXIS
        SP[Selective Memory<br/>96%] --> |best| AXIS
    end
```

The degradation from full-history persistence occurs because stale reasoning traces **bias** the agent toward past decision paths. When the task, schema, or tools change between sessions, the agent follows obsolete traces instead of adapting to the current context. Selective memory avoids this by discarding all intermediate reasoning while preserving only structural, reusable knowledge.

## The Four Categories of Reusable Context

The paper identifies exactly four categories worth persisting across sessions:

```mermaid
graph TD
    SP[Selective Persistent Memory] --> T1[1. Task Specifications]
    SP --> T2[2. Data Schemas]
    SP --> T3[3. Tool Configurations]
    SP --> T4[4. Output Constraints]

    T1 --> T1D["What the agent was asked to do<br/>Goal descriptions, success criteria"]
    T2 --> T2D["Structure and constraints of data sources<br/>Tables, fields, types, relationships"]
    T3 --> T3D["Which tools, how configured<br/>What patterns worked, parameter ranges"]
    T4 --> T4D["Format, style, validation requirements<br/>Schema of expected outputs"]

    style SP fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32,stroke-width:2px
    style T1 fill:#fff3e0
    style T2 fill:#fff3e0
    style T3 fill:#fff3e0
    style T4 fill:#fff3e0
```

### Task Specifications

The high-level description of what the agent is asked to accomplish — goal statements, success criteria, domain of the task. These persist because similar tasks recur across users and sessions. Example: "Generate a weekly sales report with trend analysis" carries reusable structure even when the underlying data changes.

### Data Schemas

The structural description of data sources — table names, field names, data types, primary/foreign key relationships, nullability constraints. These are **expensive to re-discover** (requiring multiple tool invocations) and **change slowly** relative to task frequency.

### Tool Configurations

Which tools are available, how they are configured (API endpoints, authentication methods, parameter ranges), and which invocation patterns have proven effective. This is the "how to work with the environment" knowledge that agents otherwise relearn each session.

### Output Constraints

The expected format, style, validation rules, and structural requirements of the agent's output. These are user-specific or team-specific preferences that stabilize over time — formatting conventions, reporting templates, required sections.

## What Is NOT Stored

Equally important is what the system **deliberately discards**:

| Stored | Discarded |
|--------|-----------|
| Task specifications | Session-specific reasoning traces |
| Data schemas | Intermediate thought chains |
| Tool configurations | Step-by-step execution logs |
| Output constraints | Transient query results |

The discarded content is **session-scoped** — it has no reuse value and actively harms future sessions by providing obsolete pathways. This is the selectivity that differentiates the approach from naive log persistence (see [[cross-session-memory|Cross-Session Memory]] for how Nova's `log.md` currently follows the naive pattern).

## Key Innovations

### Workspace-Based Sharing

Selective memory is encapsulated in **workspaces** — bounded containers that package the four context categories for a specific domain or task family. Workspaces can be:

- **Transferred across users** with role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Shared across sessions** without leaking user-specific data
- **Versioned** — schema changes propagate without invalidating old artifacts

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U1 as User A
    participant W as Workspace<br/>(Selective Memory)
    participant U2 as User B

    U1->>W: Create workspace<br/>(task specs, schemas, tools, constraints)
    Note over W: Store four reusable context categories<br/>Discard reasoning traces
    U2->>W: Access workspace (RBAC)
    U2->>U2: Generate with inherited context<br/>— no relearning
    Note over U2: Fresh reasoning for current session
```

This maps conceptually to Nova's `conference/` directory — a shared memory surface where structured context persists across agent invocations (see [[agent-conference-protocol|Agent Conference Protocol]]).

### Zero-Token Data Refresh

A critical innovation: **decouple generated programs from the runtime data they operate on**. When a data source updates (e.g., new rows in a table), the artifact (generated code, report template, query plan) is reused **without re-invoking the LLM**. The paper reports:

- **14× task-time reduction** (runtime refresh vs full regeneration)
- **Zero LLM tokens consumed** for data-only updates
- **12/12 trials succeeded** — zero failures in zero-token refresh

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Traditional: Full Regeneration"
        UPD[Data Update] --> LLM1[LLM Re-Invoke<br/>Full tokens] --> OUT1[Regenerated Output]
    end
    subgraph "Selective Memory: Zero-Token Refresh"
        UPD2[Data Update] --> CACHE[Retrieve Artifact<br/>from Workspace] --> RERUN[Re-execute with<br/>new data] --> OUT2[Refreshed Output]
    end
    style CACHE fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0
    style RERUN fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0
```

### Summary-Driven Generation

Instead of injecting raw data into the LLM context, the system generates **dense summaries** of the selective memory contents. This achieves:

- **97× token cost reduction** per invocation (summary vs raw data injection)
- Higher-quality generation by focusing the LLM on structural patterns rather than raw data

## Relevance to Nova Vault

Nova's current cross-session memory strategy (boot sequence → `log.md` append-only → `AGENTS.md` schema layer) can learn several lessons from selective persistent memory:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Selective Memory Pattern"
        SM1[Task Specs] 
        SM2[Data Schemas]
        SM3[Tool Configs]
        SM4[Output Constraints]
    end

    subgraph "Nova Vault Mapping"
        NV1["AGENTS.md<br/>(schema, rules, conventions)"]
        NV2["index.md + concepts.md<br/>(knowledge graph structure)"]
        NV3[".agents/skills/ + _agents/<br/>(skill & agent configs)"]
        NV4["templates/ + conventions<br/>(output format constraints)"]
    end

    SM1 -.->|analogous to| NV1
    SM2 -.->|analogous to| NV2
    SM3 -.->|analogous to| NV3
    SM4 -.->|analogous to| NV4
```

### Current Gap: log.md as Naive Full History

Nova's `log.md` is essentially **naive full-history persistence** — every session appends a chronological entry, reasoning traces and all. Per the paper's findings, this risks:

1. **Stale context bias**: Old log entries may bias future agents toward obsolete decisions
2. **No selectivity**: log.md stores session-scoped reasoning alongside reusable structural knowledge
3. **Growth without compression**: No mechanism to summarize or prune low-value entries

### Proposed Enhancement: Selective Forgetting Layer

A future vault enhancement could introduce a **compression/selection layer** that periodically:

1. Scans `log.md` for patterns matching the four reusable categories
2. Extracts structural knowledge into dedicated concept notes
3. Compresses or prunes session-scoped reasoning traces
4. Maintains a "working memory" workspace analogous to the paper's model

This would align Nova's memory architecture with the empirical finding that **selective memory (96%) > no memory (79%) > full history (71%)**.
