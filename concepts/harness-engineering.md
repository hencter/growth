  Harness engineering moves deterministic agent behavior from prompts into code, manifests, schemas, and validation artifacts, preserving both safety and utility where prompt-only approaches fail. Code-owned guarantees are load-bearing and not reproducible by prompting alone.

# Harness Engineering

## Overview

LLM agent applications begin life as prototypes — behavior is carried by natural-language prompts. Productionizing these prototypes for enterprise use requires moving from "prompts as contracts" to "code as contracts." **Harness engineering** is the design pattern that achieves this: deterministic guarantees are extracted from prompts and encoded into a layered harness of manifests, schemas, validator artifacts, and a composition boundary. The LLM still contributes runtime intelligence, but the harness ensures that every output reaching the user is auditable, reproducible, and safe.

The core insight: **prompt instructions alone cannot enforce constraints.** The paper demonstrates that prompt-only guardrails let instruction violations reach the user; a harness blocks them entirely, while preserving full utility (120/120 on the benchmark) where bolt-on guardrails over-refuse (88/120).

## Architecture

    subgraph Harness["Harness (Deterministic / Code)"]
        M[Manifests<br/>declarative specs]
        S[Schemas<br/>output format validation]
        V[Validator Artifacts<br/>code-level enforcement]
    end

    subgraph Agent["Agent (Probabilistic / LLM)"]
        LLM[LLM Model]
    end

    CB{{Composition Boundary}}

### Harness Layers

| Layer | Responsibility | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Manifests** | Declarative specification of sources, entities, and answer contracts | YAML/JSON declaring which data sources are authoritative, which entities the agent may discuss, and what shape answers must take |
| **Schemas** | Output format validation | JSON Schema, Pydantic models, type constraints on agent output |
| **Validator Artifacts** | Code that enforces contracts before output reaches the user | Pre-output hooks that check source-backedness, entity routing correctness, and contract compliance |
| **Composition Boundary** | The seam between harness (deterministic) and agent (probabilistic) | A well-defined interface where agent output is intercepted, validated, and either passed through or rejected |

## Key Principles

### 1. Code-Owned Guarantees Are Load-Bearing

Prompt instructions produce **SHOULD-level** compliance — the model may or may not follow them. Code produces **MUST-level** enforcement — violations are mechanically impossible.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Prompt-Only["Prompt-Only (SHOULD)"]
        P[Prompt Instruction] --> LLM1[LLM]
        LLM1 --> O1[Output]
        O1 --> R1[Reader]
        V1["❌ Violations pass through"]
    end

    subgraph Harness-Protected["Harness-Protected (MUST)"]
        H[Harness Rules] --> CB2{{Composition Boundary}}
        LLM2[LLM Output] --> CB2
        CB2 -->|pass| R2[Reader]
        CB2 -->|block| X["✋ Output rejected"]
    end

    style V1 fill:#f66,stroke:#333
    style X fill:#f96,stroke:#333
    style CB2 fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px
```

The harness is **load-bearing**: remove it, and the guarantees collapse. No amount of prompt engineering reproduces the deterministic enforcement.

### 2. Harness Preserves Utility, Guardrails Over-Refuse

A common enterprise pattern is to bolt on safety guardrails (content filters, output scanners) after the agent. The paper benchmarks this:

| Approach | Utility Preserved | Safety Achieved |
|----------|:---:|:---:|
| Prompt-only | 120/120 | Violations escape |
| Bolt-on guardrails | 88/120 | Partial safety |
| **Harness engineering** | **120/120** | **Full safety** |

Bolt-on guardrails operate post-hoc — they can only reject, not restructure. They lack source-awareness and entity-routing knowledge, so they both over-refuse (false positives that kill utility) and under-block (violations they cannot detect). The harness, by contrast, knows the contract and validates at the composition boundary.

### 3. Model Substitution Resilience

The harness is model-agnostic. The paper tested the same harness against 3 different hosted models on all 270 composition-boundary runs:

```mermaid
graph LR
    H[Harness] --> CB{{Composition Boundary}}
    CB --> M1[Model A]
    CB --> M2[Model B]
    CB --> M3[Model C]
    CB --> V[Validation]

    M1 -.->|failures confined here| M1
    M2 -.->|failures confined here| M2
    M3 -.->|failures confined here| M3
    V -->|all validated| Out[Safe Output]
```

Failures were **confined to the model-composed side** — the harness caught them regardless of which model produced the violation. This means the agent model is replaceable without recertification of the safety envelope.

### 4. Fault-Injection Control

Validator artifacts can deliberately inject broken contracts to verify that the harness detects them. This enables:
- **CI/CD testing** of harness rules
- **Regression detection** when model upgrades change behavior
- **Compliance auditing** with reproducible failure traces

## Composition Boundary in Detail

The composition boundary is the core architectural concept. It is a **replaceable seam** — the LLM model behind it can be swapped, fine-tuned, or upgraded without changing the harness contracts.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant H as Harness
    participant CB as Composition Boundary
    participant M as LLM Model

    U->>H: Query
    H->>H: Load manifest (sources, entities)
    H->>H: Build schema constraints
    H->>CB: Validated prompt + constraints
    CB->>M: Forward
    M->>CB: Raw agent output
    CB->>H: Intercept
    H->>H: Validate against contracts
    alt Output passes all validators
        H->>U: Safe, contracted answer
    else Output violates contract
        H->>U: Structured error + trace
        Note over H: Violation logged for audit
    end
```

## Relevance to Nova Vault

Nova's `AGENTS.md` currently defines rules as natural language (SHOULD-level). The harness engineering pattern suggests several hardening opportunities:

| Current (SHOULD) | Potential (MUST) |
|---|---|
| Boot sequence rules in prose | Code-level validation that required files were read |
| Frontmatter completeness conventions | Schema validation on `Write` operations |
| Lint protocol as agent task | Formalized validation artifacts with reproducible checks |
| Auto-commit as skill instruction | Deterministic git hook with pre-commit validation |
| Link integrity ("at least 1-3 links") | Schema-enforced at note creation time |

The implicit hypothesis: a **harness-manifested AGENTS.md** would produce strictly more reliable vault maintenance than the current natural-language approach. The `auto-commit` plugin-to-skill migration (logged in [log.md](/log.md)) is itself a concrete example of the reliability gap: a deterministic plugin (WILL-level) was replaced by a skill instruction (SHOULD-level), trading reliability for portability.

## Comparison: Harness vs Related Patterns

| Pattern | What it enforces | Enforcement layer |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Permission Models** (`allow`/`ask`/`deny`) | *Can* the agent execute this tool? | Execution gate |
| **Context Management** (compaction, token budgets) | *Does* the agent have the right context? | Input shaping |
| **Skills** (SKILL.md injection) | *Should* the agent follow this workflow? | Instruction (SHOULD) |
| **Harness Engineering** | *Must* the output conform to this contract? | Output validation (MUST) |

Harness engineering is complementary to all three: it operates at the **output boundary**, while permissions operate at the **execution boundary**, context management at the **input boundary**, and skills at the **instruction boundary**.
